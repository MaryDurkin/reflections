Git uses a 'staging area' to hold files before committing
The three conceptual areas are: working directory, staging area and repository

git add <file> to add files to the staging area

git rm --cached <file> to remove them

Staging area is different because it assembles files before making a committ. Gives a moment to pause to make sure all and only the files in the logical stage are added


git diff    with no arguements compares the files in the staging area with those in the working directory
git diff --staged 	compares those in the staging area with the most recent commit in the repository.
git diff comit_id_old commit_id_newer compares different commits

git reset --hard  discards changes in the working directory or the staging area USE WITH CAUTION


git commit  makes a commit of the staging area to the repository

git branch (with no arguments) shows the branch you are on

git branch branch-name - creates a branch called, you guessed it branch name

git checkout branch-name - checks  out the branch branch-name

So perhaps use branches when you are just seeing how things might look, need a different version or hav't decided to implement thr changes
