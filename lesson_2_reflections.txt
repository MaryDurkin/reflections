Git uses a 'staging area' to hold files before committing
The three conceptual areas are: working directory, staging area and repository
git add <file> to add files to the staging area
git rm --cached <file> to remove them

Staging area is different because it assembles files before making a committ. Gives a moment to pause to make sure all and only the files in the logical stage are added


git diff    with no arguements compares the files in the staging area with those in the working directory
git diff --staged 	compares those in the staging area with the most recent commit in the repository.
git diff comit_id_old commit_id_newer compares different commits

git reset --hard  discards changes in the working directory or the staging area USE WITH CAUTION
